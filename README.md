### 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm Daniel from Porto, Portugal 🇵🇹  
I'm working in logistics at IKEA while studying software development.  
I'm passionate about technology and problem-solving, and I'm currently looking for an opportunity to start my career as a **Software Developer**.  

I’ve built several projects using **Java, Spring Boot, SQL, REST APIs, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript**, and I’m always trying to improve my skills and learn new technologies.  
I’m also interested in **Networking (CCNA)** and **Cybersecurity**, as I enjoy understanding how systems communicate and stay secure.  

🚀 My goal is to join a tech company where I can grow, contribute, and keep learning every day.
